## Project Description

This project is a personal portfolio website developed during my internship at GenZ EducateWing Company. The website is designed using HTML and CSS, showcasing my skills, projects, and contact information in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner. 
It serves as a digital resume, highlighting my professional background and providing contact information for potential employers or collaborators.
